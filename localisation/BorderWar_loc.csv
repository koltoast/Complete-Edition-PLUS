dec_SAF_border_war_desc;With the peace treaty for the Angolan War for Independence now officially signed, the left-wing MPLA party has seized control of Luanda and has formed a government for the people. UNITA and the military arm of the autocratic SWAPO party, PLAN, have risen up against the new government, stating that they have the only true right to rule. Given our close ties to UNITA – as well as our ideological similarities – it is our duty to join their cause and depose the illegitimate SWAPO party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME289010;Angolan Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC289010;Laboring under endemic oppression, Angolan peasants who have been forced to work in cotton fields for the profit of European companies have burned their identification cards in an act of civil disobedience. Moreover, militants of the left-wing Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA) have staged an attack on a police station in our Angolan possession, killing seven officers. Our forces of order have cracked down on these illegitimate acts. However, our government fears that this signals the beginning of a time of troubles for our rule over Angola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA289010;Ungrateful Anarchists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME289011;Angolan War for Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC289011;The unrest in Angola has erupted into open war. The Union of Peoples of Angola (UPA) has crossed into the country from its bases in Zaire, taking government posts, trade centers, and massacring Africans and whites alike. Our sparse occupation forces stood no chance and have been routed, leaving the territory in the hands of the rebels. Fearing the rebel advance, our citizens and colonial subjects have taken to the road, abandoning their property and fleeing their homes ahead of the rebel forces. Though currently on the defensive, we have the ability to deploy troops to reinforce the threatened areas and mount a counterattack posthaste. Such a move by us would signal the beginning of the Angolan War for Independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA289011;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB289011;The age of Empire is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME289012;End of Angolan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC289012;The Angolan war has been bitterly fought and blood has flowed freely on all sides. However, despite the best efforts of our military and heroic resolve of our people, the despicable rebels have finally clawed away a majority of Angola’s territory from our control, murdering and pillaging as they went. As it stands, we are compelled to renounce our claims on our long-held possession of Angola. It is a bitter pill to swallow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302000;International Court Ruling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302000;Our territory of South-West Africa, won through legitimate force of arms from Imperial Germany for the cause of Freedom, whose ownership was subsequently recognized by the international community, and which rightfully belongs to us, is being pried from the body of our nation by the UN and their lackeys at the International Court of Justice. That court has ruled that our rightful claim is invalid and that we should renounce our possession of the territory. We can ignore the dictate of the UN – as is our right – or accept it and negotiate with whichever new regime takes over South-West Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302000;South-West Africa is ours, won by conquest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB302000;We shall accept this ruling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME302001;Namibian War for Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302001;The ungrateful opponents of our rule in South-West Africa have accreted enough strength to begin mounting worryingly-sophisticated attacks from their bush hideouts. We have noticed an uptick in attacks along our northern border, but our helicopter-supported police forces have proven to be outgunned by the insurgents who have some sponsor trafficking weapons to them. We need to consider sending in our armed forces to put down this unlawful insurrection once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, the Angolan people’s struggle with rightist reactionaries is not yet over. The UNITA are claiming power for themselves and are enforcing their dictate with the gun.
