EVTNAME181110;Constitution for Malta Drafted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC181110;Sir Harold MacMichael, our colonial commissioner currently appointed to Malta, has finished drafting a constitution for the archipelago which would return to it limited self-government, in line with commitments made during the Second World War.\nThis near-dominion status would have us retain control over the archipelago's foreign affairs.\n\nAlternatively, we could grant the archipelago complete self-government within the commonwealth, or retain direct control over it at a risk to our international prestige and unrest among the territory's inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME181111;Malta Presents Referendum Results;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC181111;The Prime Minister of our dominion Malta has presented us with the results of a referendum recently held on the archipelago, showing clear and decisive support for an integration of the archipelago into the United Kingdom. Their Prime Minister insists that the Maltese should enjoy the same political, social and economic status and opportunities that British citizens do.\n\nWe can accept or reject their proposal; there are concerns being voiced by the Colonial Office that to reject it could strengthen determination in Malta for complete independence, but integrating a territory with its own long-established culture and history into our own civil, political and economic institutions would present challenges as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME253000;$YEAR$ UK Integration Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC253000;We have established a constitutional referendum on integration with the United Kingdom, seeking to gauge the public's support for such a crucial decision before choosing whether to seek London's approval for us becoming politically, socially and economically part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe results should be returned to us within a few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA253000;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME253001;Church Lobbies Against Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC253001;The Catholic church has long been a powerful and pervasive force in Malta, the opinions they choose to preach and the objectives they choose to promote to their congregation can hold considerable sway upon Maltese politics.\nThe Maltese Catholic church has taken particular interest in the ongoing referendum on integration with the United Kingdom. They fear that under a British government their place in Maltese society and the privileges they enjoy because of it would be under threat, and have been promoting such concerns and opposition to the referendum to the overwhelmingly Catholic population at-large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME253002;Referendum Results Favour Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC253002;The results of the referendum we commissioned into possible integration with the United Kingdom have been returned, and they strongly favour integration. There can be no doubt a significant majority of our population are in favour of us becoming politically, socially and economically part of the United Kingdom.\n\nIf we wish to we can still declare this referendum null-and-void, although this could risk decreasing our political popularity as well as possible unrest.\nOtherwise, we will now send the referendum results to London and wait to see how they respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although a majority of ballots returned are in favour of integration turnout has been rather low, possibly as a result of calls by some civil and religious organisations to boycott the referendum.\n\nWe can now either abandon the referendum and the aim of integration on account of its unclear results, or try to push ahead with integration and send the results to London to see how they respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
