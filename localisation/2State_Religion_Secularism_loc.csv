establish_moral_police_desc;"From all sides, day and night, our blessed society is besieged by forces that cannot be defeated with blood and bullets – the enemy is the insidious creep of corrupting influences that cause our good people to be led astray from the one true path. They need a shepherd to lead them back to the fold; a holy protector, ever-vigilant, who will guard them against temptation. A force of devout religious police will be that guardian of the people’s morality! With such a holy instrument at our disposal, we will transform our society from the ground up into a paragon of virtue.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
demobilize_moral_police_title;Demobilize Moral Police;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
demobilize_moral_police_desc;Whether because we now understand that individual morality should not be subject to policing like criminal activity, or our religious police simply have no more work in such a perfectly moral society as ours, the time has come to bring an end to the religious police force in our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establish_theocracy_dissent_title;Forcibly Establish Theocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establish_theocracy_dissent_desc;"We are certain with all our soul that this nation should be ruled directly by our deity and that all other modes of governance by definition exist in sin. We can no longer wait to establish direct divine rule in our nation; if we must impose the almighty on the unwilling, they will be forgiven for opposing us. One way or another, we shall have a theocratic state.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establish_theocracy_popular_title;Establish Theocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
establish_theocracy_popular_desc;"Our people yearn for this nation to be ruled directly by our deity and chafe at the current secular status quo. They cry out for religious law and a religious state and beg us their government to bring them into the light of the divine presence. We must heed their call; this nation’s government and its god shall become one. No longer shall petty, secular politics inhibit our destiny of becoming a religious paradise.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_alcohol_title;Ban Alcohol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_alcohol_desc;"Intoxicating libations have wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s godly population! For some, the temptation of drink is irresistible and causes them to fall into slovenly debauchery. Moreover, the presence of alcohol in our society exacerbates the human failings of those who desperately need our guidance, preventing us from leading them on the path of righteousness. Let us eradicate the problem at its source; let us eradicate alcohol from our hallowed land!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lift_alcohol_ban_title;Lift Alcohol Ban;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lift_alcohol_ban_desc;Our ban on alcoholic beverages has not met with widespread public support, to say the least. The consensus among our advisors is that leaving the ban in place will do more harm than good at this point, and that we can likely serve the spiritual interests of our people in other ways than by keep them away from the temptation to drink to excess. It is only with the consolation of our unwavering faith in our god that we will rescind our ban on evil alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_other_religions_title;Ban Non-State Religions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_other_religions_desc;There are those among us who sinfully resist the one true religion, and what’s worse, they are tempting the faithful among us with their dark ways. And all with the full sanction of our law! We can change that. Let us remove the unjust protection of the law from the writhing wretches that it now protects! Let the heathens squirm beneath the full glory of the one true faith and its adherents! No longer shall we debase ourselves by accommodating their kind amongst us! Ban all religions but the one true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_other_religions_title;Unban Non-State Religions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_other_religions_desc;The excesses of the past theocratic regime have done great damage to civil society and religious minorities. Particularly, the previous regime’s autocratic ban of religious dissenters has led to hideous abuses of the fundamental human right of dignity and self-expression. Let us revoke the backwards laws banning the practice of non-state religions and embrace our national diversity as a strength instead of treating it as a failing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_religion_title;Ban Organized Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_religion_desc;"Religion – that opiate of the masses, that alternative authority, that disease that corrupts the people in their allegiance to the State. For too long have false leaders scraped out influence among our people by appealing to their base fears and uncertainties. That is our domain! The State is the answer to all hopes and dreams; it alone can be the only object of the people’s adulation! For too long as religion stolen the loyalty of the people. At its best, it is a distraction; at its worst, a threat to our authority. Our course is clear: we shall eradicate all religion from our nation.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_religion_title;Unban Organized Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_religion_desc;In retrospect, the ban on organized religion has caused much more harm than good. Whether it is due to popular unrest and sense of oppression caused by prohibiting our people’s fundamental beliefs, or because we no longer subscribe to the totalitarian mindset that gave rise to the ban in the first place, it is now time to allow our citizens to worship as they choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_contraceptives_title;Ban Contraceptives/Abortion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ban_contraceptives_desc;Greater multitudes of believers will glorify our religion, and what better way to gain new believers than for our godly people to conceive them en masse? Especially if our economy is humming, why not simply do away with the outmoded technologies to control conception? After all, a newborn child is always a blessing. Let there be babies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_contraceptives_title;Unban Contraceptives/Abortion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unban_contraceptives_desc;Our nation has come a long way since we considered banning contraceptives to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end. It is time to get rid of the deplorable law that discredits our ideals by trampling a woman’s right to control her own body. The state has no business imposing its will on the reproductive decisions of its citizens. The law banning contraceptives belongs in the trash bin of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
one_child_law_title;Pass One-Child Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
one_child_law_desc;The grave predictions of our top minds that our wild population growth will inevitably bring anarchy and ruin to our great nation have not fallen on deaf ears. Lest Malthus prove prophetic, we must enact strict – perhaps even harsh – measures to get ahead of the coming population explosion in our nation. The choice is quite clear—if we do not act, within a single generation our rule will certainly fall to a tsunami of young, unemployed revolutionaries whose vast numbers no economy could ever hope to absorb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revoke_one_child_law_title;Revoke One-Child Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revoke_one_child_law_desc;Data from recent years indicate that our population crisis has been successfully averted in part due to our strict one-child policy. Therefore, the law has become obsolescent and is hereby revoked. Let this stand as a triumph of prospective collective action undertaken to overcome a common threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_republic_title;Reform Theocracy to Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_republic_desc;The time has come to do away with our theocratic form of governance for one that better reflects our national values and democratic aspirations. A republican form of governance is the best way forward for our great country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_cons_monarchy_title;Reform Theocracy to Constituional Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_cons_monarchy_desc;The time has come to do away with our theocratic form of governance for one that better reflects our national values and democratic aspirations. A constitutional monarchy is the best way to balance our traditional values with progressive forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_authoritarian_gov_title;Reform Theocracy to Authoritarian Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_theoc_to_authoritarian_gov_desc;The time has come to do away with our theocratic form of governance for one that better reflects our national values and democratic aspirations. A single, strong ruler will be able to guide the nation to prosperity and greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50300;Adopt a Theocratic Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50300;Our state operates under a secular constitution without a single mention of the guiding principles of our dearest religion, despite how devout our people are and how ingrained our religion is in the identity of our nation. Consequently, a sizeable and growing minority of our citizens and political elite are agitating for a new constitution that incorporates our religion directly into our law. How shall we deal with this situation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50300;Amend the constitution in due time, after deliberation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50300;Force through necessary changes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50301;Angry Secularists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50301;Our attempts at changing our constitution to reflect our nation’s deeply-held religiosity have been defeated by a highly-coordinated campaign by indignant secularists who seem determined to hold their nation back from closer communion with the divine. Such ignorance is intolerable! Our spiritual paradise will not come easily, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50301;Damn them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50302;A New Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50302;We have established a new constitution that subordinates the state to the will of our god! We shall live in peace and light by following our religion’s teachings as law that not even the state can break! This is a glorious day that shall be remembered into eternity as a new birth for our holy nation! Now we must set to work building our fortress of divinity on earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50302;Praise be to our divine being!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50303;Divine Crucible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50303;"Although we are certain that our religion can be the only source of law and order in our nation, our establishment of it as the supreme law of the land has sparked rioting and violence in the dissenters among us. The die is cast; we shall have to do all we can to minister to our people so that they may understand that we have made our decision with love, not hatred, in our hearts.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50303;Let's hope they listen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50304;Public Skeptical of Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50304;The people do not seem to care one way or another what constitution they live under and are displaying remarkable ambivalence toward the new constitution. Although their lack of religious fervor is perhaps worrying, at least we are not facing opposition to our new policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50304;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50305;Public Angered by Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50305;The people are enraged at our rewritten constitution and have taken to the street to protest against our rule. Already there are riots and destruction of private property, and we fear that soon there will be violence against individuals who support our government. The elements against the new constitution do not seem to be open to persuasion, so it appears that we face a long road of reconciliation ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50305;Faith guides us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50306;Clergy Supports Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50306;"Clerical support for our religious constitutional reforms has successfully calmed the militant critics of our government, and we now face no significant opposition to implementing new policies based on our religious values. This is great news; the future is bright for our holy nation!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50306;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50307;Public Supports Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50307;The jubilant roar of crowds in the streets must surely reverberate in the heavens above, for the entire nation has issued forth in celebration of its new divine state. Our government is now the object of the public’s unbridled support, which gives us an opportunity that is seldom enjoyed: a popular mandate to solidify our holy rule to perpetuity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50307;Let us celebrate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50307;Let us solidify our rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50308;Widespread Popular Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50308;As we already knew, the people fully back our enlightened rule and have given their full support to our expansion of control over the state. Our holy government will rule for eternity and the people love us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50308;Mwahaha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50309;Public Feels Betrayed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50309;"Surprisingly, the people have reacted negatively to the establishment of our perpetual rule; they feel betrayed, evidently not realizing that our divine guidance cannot falter. They have submitted demands to loosen elections in order to restore democratic choice to our government. Granting their demand will placate our critics, but it will also significantly diminish our power.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50309;No concessions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50309;Allow regular elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50310;Popular Outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50310;In an unthinkable reversal of course, the people have taken up arms against our rule after the indefinite extension of our divine rule! They have switched from jubilant crowds in the streets to militant mobs and are demanding that we immediately abandon our right to indefinite power! Otherwise, they threaten to remove us by force. Oh divine one, give us Your guidance in these trying times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50310;No concessions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50310;Rescind our absolute rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50311;Our Religion Banned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50311;Sad news for our divine government: $FROMCOUNTRY$ have banned our religion from their territory. Theirs is a dark land, and perhaps one day we will have the opportunity to show them the light of our religion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50311;We shall pray for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50312;Religion Ban Lifted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50312;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has seen the light and lifted their ban on our religion! The true believers among them may now worship in the open. We welcome this happy news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50312;A joyous occasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50313;Reforms Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50313;The old theocrats failed to establish a religious constitution after winning control over the government, and now it appears that their moment to do so has passed. The political pendulum swings inexorably away from theocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50313;Oh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50314;Constitutional Friction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50314;Our clergy is growing very concerned with the legal situation of our so-called ‘theocracy.’ Why, they ask, does our purportedly divine state belabor itself with an oppressively secular constitution, a constitution that leaves absolutely no room for religion in public life? In the opinion of our religious elite, our failure to incorporate our religion into the state itself is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50314;We're still working on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50314;Force constitutional changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC50314;Re-establish secularism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50315;Clergy Issues Condemnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50315;The clergy has blasted our rule for being ‘against the divine will’ and ‘heretical,’ in response to our recent actions that they feel is a step away from direct religious rule. This will hurt our standing among our religious citizens very much, and might spark mass demonstrations against our government!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50315;Darn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50316;Threats of Excommunication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50316;Grave news: our nation’s clergy has issued an ultimatum after our recent moves away from establishing a fully-integrated religious state – if we do not make their religion the supreme law of the land, they will excommunicate our government and its leaders from the divine presence. If this occurs, the ramifications will shake our legitimacy to its core and may cleave a rift through our very society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50316;We'll take our chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50316;Reconsider our plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC50316;Resign and apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50317;Public Supports Secularism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50317;The public has come out in support of our decision to become secular. They have unequivocally shown their support by letter writing and peacefully demonstrating in support of our government. Moreover, the vocal minority opposing our secular push have been overwhelmingly silenced by the outpouring of popular support for a secular government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50317;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50318;Popular Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50318;The public has come out in support of our decision to become secular despite the clerical excommunication of our government. The people have unequivocally shown their support by letter writing and peacefully demonstrating in support of our government. Moreover, the vocal minority opposing our secular push have been overwhelmingly silenced by the outpouring of popular support for a secular government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50318;Fantastic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50319;Assassination!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50319;Terrible news: our head of government has been assassinated by pro-theocracy extremists while delivering a speech to the nation. Our nation is in shock at this unthinkable crime and our security services are hard at work to bring the perpetrators to justice. We shall mourn the loss of our dedicated public servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50319;A sad day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50320;Preaching the True Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50320;"We have conquered new territory whose people do not know the one true faith. Not to worry; we will bring it to them! Our divine state can only benefit from new converts to our religion!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50320;Glory to the Divine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50321;Religious Bans Lifted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50321;We have liberated territory where our religion was banned by the previous government and have gloriously cast open the doors of worship once again! The faithful will again lift their voices in praise to the one true religion and will glorify our wonderful divine state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50321;Praise be to the Divine Presence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50322;Conversion Complete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50322;Wonderful news! Our steadfast effort at converting the people of one of our provinces has now succeeded in a majority of citizens following the one true faith. This is a cause for celebration and praise to our holy Deity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50322;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50323;Religion Ban Lifted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50323;We have lifted the ban on other religions than the state’s due to our shift to a more secular form of government. We hope that our people will feel free to express their religion, whatever it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50323;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50324;A New Beginning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50324;After a long process of rewriting law #CODEs and much political wrangling, our state is now secular and republican. We expect that this will meet with outrage from the religious factions among our population, but we do what we must to ensure a bright future for our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50324;A new dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50325;Cleric Resigns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50325;Our head religious leader has resigned in outrage at the news of our further secularization. Hopefully this is not a harbinger for greater internal strife among the supporters of theocracy among our population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50325;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50326;Religious Hardliners Outraged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50326;Fanatical supporters of the previous head of state are out for blood and are calling for a revolution. Although this only appears to be so much bluster for now, we fear that many among our people who support a theocratic government are susceptible to these religious hardliners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50326;Worrisome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50327;Change in Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50327;After much public strife, our government has settled on an arrangement of power in which a secular monarch presides over a government whose head of state is a religious leader. We hope that the two forces, secular and religious, will balance each other and bring stability to our fractious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50327;Let us hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50328;Meet the New Boss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50328;After much public strife, our government has settled on an arrangement of power in which a secular autocrat wields absolute power over a government whose head of state is a religious leader. We hope that the two forces, secular and religious, will balance each other and bring stability to our fractious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50328;We'll see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50329;Moral Police Misconduct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50329;Our moral police, far from enforcing the teachings of our religion, have instead been engaging in immoral behavior. They have been spotted in all kinds of compromising situations, apparently drunk on power or more intoxicating substances. The situation is receiving national attention and therefore we should consider acting to correct it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50329;Some spoiled eggs do not ruin the bunch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50329;Punish the offenders and re-educate the rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50330;Moral Police Popular;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50330;Our moral police are wildly popular and can be found performing all manner of upstanding deeds, from rescuing cats from tall trees to scolding aberrant citizens for stealing kisses when they think they can’t be seen. The moral police see everything, but that is just fine as far as our citizens are concerned when the moral police are so thoroughly...moral!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50330;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50331;Official Misconduct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50331;Some of our government officials have been exposed in compromising situations very much in opposition to their oath to uphold the highest religious morals of our society. We must act to remedy the situation or risk losing legitimacy in the eyes of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50331;All we can do is apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50331;Campaign to remove them from office!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50332;Immoral Ministers Ousted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50332;We have succeeded in ousting the immoral ministers, but we’ve angered quite a few secularists in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50332;Can't please everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50333;Immoral Ministers Stay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50333;We have failed to oust the immoral ministers and the secularists in our society have managed to turn public opinion against us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50333;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50334;National Religious Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50334;A new religious revival movement is spreading rapidly across our country, apparently started by nothing in particular. Across all strata of society, a new religious consciousness has taken root that is causing people to reaffirm their faith in a variety of ways, both conventional and avant-garde. This ‘religious awakening’ is just beginning to show its effects and its full ramifications are still to come – no one can predict how, or even if, this movement will fundamentally alter our nation’s society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50334;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50335;Shift in Public Mood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50335;The new religious awakening sweeping our nation has found an ally in the autocratic political parties in our political system who have always supported traditional values as part of their political platform. These new religious activists emphasize spirituality as a source of strength and meaning, and therefore are naturally drawn toward the political parties that emphasize traditional values as central to a well-ordered society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50335;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50336;Shift in Public Mood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50336;The new religious awakening sweeping our nation have begun attacking our political system’s social liberal and left-wing political parties. These new religious activists emphasize spirituality as a source of strength and meaning, and they see liberal politics as antithetical to their beliefs. Consequently, support for liberal politics in our nation has begun a dramatic slump that will likely continue for some time to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50336;Worrisome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50337;New Age Spirituality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50337;A confusing new spirituality movement is spreading rapidly across our country, apparently started by nothing in particular but motivated by an urge to understand the supernatural world. This ‘New Age’ movement is causing people to seek out spiritual meaning in a bewildering variety of unconventional ways. The New Age movement is just beginning to show its effects and its full ramifications are still to come – no one can predict how, or even if, this movement will fundamentally alter our nation’s society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50337;Bewildering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50338;New Age Pacifists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50338;A generation influenced by New Age spirituality has become more pacifist, resulting in many more demonstrations against war and a general refusal to work for ‘the man,’ vaguely defined as any entity connected to traditional society or values. What is this country coming to?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50338;Damned Hippies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50339;New Age War Objectors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50339;A generation influenced by New Age spirituality has become actively opposed to our war and to conscription, resulting in widespread anti-war demonstrations and a general refusal to work for ‘the man,’ vaguely defined as any entity connected to traditional society or values. Also on the increase are ‘draft dodgers,’ people who claim to be conscientious objectors in order to avoid serving in the military. What is this country coming to?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
