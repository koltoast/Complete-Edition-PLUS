1959_vietnam_war_desc;The Vietnam War was a Cold War-era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The Viet Cong, a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist common front directed by the North, largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME177009;The Vietnam War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC177009;The invasion of South Vietnam would be a costly one, several nations such as the USA might come to the South Vietnamese aid, but in due time and with the proper tactics we should be able to reunify the nation once more. On the other hand we could proclaim our support for a divided Vietnam. One way or the other, Indochina will change dramatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA177009;Let us unify our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME177010;Formation of the Viet Cong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC177010;The Viet Cong, or National Liberation Front (NLF), was a political organization and army in South Vietnam and Cambodia that fought the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War. It had both guerrilla and regular army units, as well as a network of cadres who organized peasants in the territory it controlled. Many soldiers were recruited in South Vietnam. During the war, communists and anti-war spokesmen insisted the Viet Cong was an insurgency indigenous to the South, while the South Vietnamese government portrayed the group as a tool of the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC177013;We have done it, the south has surrendered to our superior army, our nation has finally been reunified. The south is still bound to bring us many problems, especially while we reintegrate it, but as things stand the future looks bright for the now unified Vietnam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC354005;"The Gulf of Tonkin incident (or the USS Maddox incident) is the name given to two separate confrontations, one actual and one false, involving North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted the President of the United States the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by ""communist aggression"". The resolution served as a legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
