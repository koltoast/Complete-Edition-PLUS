EVTNAME170104;The German Question ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC170104;After 1945 and the defeat of the Third Reich, Germany became divided by allied occupation. Formalized in an official agreement, the occupation would eventually evolve into East Germany and West Germany, as well as the military occupation zone of Berlin. In fact, the US, the UK and France never formally acknowledged the authority of the East German government to govern East Berlin, as the official Allied protocol recognized only the authority of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole. This view was to be supported by the continued practice of patrols of Allied soldiers of all four Allies in all four sectors. Thus, occasionally Western Allied soldiers were on patrol in East Berlin and Soviet soldiers were patrolling in West Berlin. The patrols would continue uncontrolled on both sides, with the tacit agreement that no nation would use their patrolling privileges for helping Germans to flee each other’s sectors. Unlike East Berlin, the western sectors would become a political enclave, surrounded by East German territory and with special status. The Western Allies were guaranteed three air corridors to their sectors of Berlin, and the gratious Soviet Union also informally allowed road and rail access between West Berlin and the western parts of Germany. At first, this arrangement was officially only meant to be a temporary administrative structure, with all parties declaring that Germany and Berlin would soon be reunited. However, as the relations between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies seamed to sour, the joint administration of Germany and Berlin was destined to break down. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Formalized in an official agreement the occupation would eventually evolve into East Germany and West Germany, as well as the military occupation zone of Berlin. According to the legal theory followed by the Western Allies, ending the Berlin occupation zones required a quadripartite agreement. In lack of such, the American, British, and French occupation sectors of Berlin would form West Berlin as a free city under the formal administration of the Western Allies instead of West Germany but maintain that the sectors were run by all the four former victorious powers.  This view was to be supported by the continued practice of patrols of Allied soldiers of all four Allies in all four sectors.
