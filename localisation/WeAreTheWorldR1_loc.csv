EVTNAME144980;The Rise of Hawthorne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC144980;Curtis Hawthorne, the son of American parents who fled to Canada during the labor unrest and depression of the 1930's. Born in British Columbia at the height of the Second World War, Curtis grew up with the rationing and general hardship that went along with supporting a massive war-effort in the name of the British Empire.\n\nAs a child he was generally reserved but was influenced by the seeds of radical socialism. He talks frequently about, how he as a child would occasionaly listen to radio broadcasts from the Eastern Front, talking of the bravery of the Soviet soldiers fighting desperately to save their homelands from the wild fascists of Germany.\n\nAt only 18 years of age, he decided to register as a member of the front party for the Communist Party of Canada but eventually he would drift from orthodox communism by embracing social change via democratic means. By the time he graduated from the University of British Columbia, he made a point to push for a role in the party apparatus in Vancouver for the left-wing radicals. An outspoken critic of colonialism, the local party made heavy use of Curtis' apparent distancing from orthodox communism as a selling point and after a tense race, the 1958 Mayoralty election for Vancouver ended in a stunning 7% victory for the seemingly unknown Hawthorne. Since then, his reputation as a honest politician has propelled him to high level politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME170980;The Rise of Zieschang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC170980;Heinrich Zieschang was born Hindrask Zieschang in an impoverished family of Lusatian Sorbs. Young Hindrask found his calling in life in the communist party and developed a passionate obsession with Marxist ideology and hero worshiped Joseph Stalin, a lifestyle that qualified him for high-ranking communist university and later helped kick-start his military career.\n\nIt was at university Hindrask took on the more Germanic name Heinrich and naturally sympathizes with the arguments of Hoxa and Mao Zedong in the fight against Khrushchev's 'revisionism'. For this purpose he organized a clandestine network of East German hardliners and maintains extensive contacts with the PRC and Albania.\n\nWhen in power, he takes the rank of supreme commander of the armed forces as well as leader of the party. Heinrich, like Mao will produce books of his own quotations and like Stalin conceal his minority identity behind a facade of German Volkish Nationalism.\n\nInternally, Heinrich blames the regimes problems on it's toleration of 'Social Fascist elements' and he aims to 'purify' the GDR of the influence of old German Social Democracy and round up all non-Communist politicians for reeducation. Like Hoxa, Heinrich wishes to fully remove all 'foreign' religious influences from German society. Heinrich is a political megalomaniac of the highest order and only his patience and shrewd intelligence has kept him alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME170984;The Rise of the Kaiser;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC170984;A former high ranking Wehrmacht officer in the German Army during WWII, Fredrick Holst opposed the views of Hitler but feared communism more than he did fascism. He fought with great honor at the Battle of France, then at Normandy, Operation Market Garden and finally at the battle of the Bulge. With the ending of the war and reinstated as a general in the East German army he created a political career from within the army. Now that he has come to power, he plans to reform East Germany back into Prussia. His political and military ambition is to first and foremost reinforce the border along communist nations and second to improve relations with the west, especially neighboring Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Poland and thus to gain international support for a reunification of german lands into Prussia. To secure the borders it's imperative to begin a massive arms build up, with the intent of crushing any communist invasion. The main plan, drawn up with the Minister of Defence focuses on a theory called 'Gepanzerten Barriere' (Armored Barrier) with the goal of creating large heavily armored formations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#ECU;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME179980;The Rise of Tejada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC179980;Born in Cuenca, the son of piping manufacturer Alberto Madrid Nuevara, Nazareno gained interest in politics while at university during the start of the Second World War. He was a pro-war proponent and advocated for Ecuador to join the fighting while at the same time he aimed to reform the democratic system in his nation.\n\nAs a social democrat he aimed for a more representative state and he believes Ecuador had become increasingly oligarchic. In inner circles Tejada somewhat paradoxicly views Ecuador as the progressive state of the region, with the duty to promote the concept of diplomatic 'pan-Hispanism' altough popular issues like anti-Peruvian sentiment in his own country would probably make such an idea unlikely. Like many politicians, he is not above smearing opponents, criticized heavily for his untruths and half-truths, as a result he is unfortunately a man prone to periods of depression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME349980;The Rise of Ibrahim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC349980;A self-taught communist, Ahmed Ibrahim lines from a poor family that suffered due to decline of the pearling industry in the early thirties. Involved in local politics in his late teens, by the early 1950's the young Arab had set up a small guerrilla organization in the same style as Fidel Castro in Cuba, aimed at removing the gulf monarchies and setting up a workers state.\n\nThe arrival of oil money and expansion of education and infrastructure in the gulf state made well educated young people observent at the unequal distribution of wealth within the state. This idealistic view allowed Ibrahim to gain support and new members and the former small scale guerilla had soon grown into a larger organization eventually gaining support, training and financial backing from the Warsaw Pact. The rest is history and now that Ibrahim has taken power, he aims to use the oil money on building up the economy and expanding the welfare system of the nation, while keeping the 'enemies of the people' at bay from launching a NATO backed contra revolution. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
