1948_war_arab_minors_title;The War in Palestine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
1948_war_arab_minors_desc;In the 19th century, Jews began to settle in Ottoman-controlled Palestine with the long-term goal of creating a Jewish state that would be sanctuary for Jews from around the world. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed during the Great War, Britain assumed mandate power over Palestine. Now the mandate has ended – and the Jewish settlers have proclaimed the so-called 'State of Israel,' which claims more than half of Palestine. The Arabs in Palestine have not accepted this and want to end Israel's existence here and now. We can support them in their fight for freedom by sending weapons and volunteers. A second option is to accept the existence of Israel and recognize them diplomatically, but this step will surely cause riots among our population. Because it will be difficult or even impossible for us to send our forces directly to Palestine, we may also leave the war to the larger Arab states and not intervene in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One possibility is to help the Arabs of Palestine in their struggle by sending volunteers and supplies.

EVTDESC180001;The war with Israel did not go as planned.

EVTDESC222000;At last, our dream has come true. After centuries of existing as a people spread across the world, Jews now have a new home in Palestine. However, the birth of Israel will not be peaceful: The Arabs in Palestine – and in the neighboring countries – vehemently oppose the partition plan and are preparing to end our existence this very moment. We will have to fight – or our dream is doomed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA222000;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME222001;New weapons and volunteers arrive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC222001;The war against the Arab states started only recently, but regardless we must reorganize our troops and continue military training if are to survive. Luckily, a lot Jewish volunteers from many foreign countries decided to join our cause. Among them are also a number of much-needed veterans of World War II. Also, the Jewish Agency has managed to smuggle weapons and ammunitions to Israel, mainly from Eastern Europe. The Arab states, on the other, hand enjoy no such support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME222002;Cease-fire with Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC222002;We have crossed the border to Egypt, something the Egyptian leadership thought impossible.

EVTNAME305000;How to deal with Israel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC305000;The Jewish settlers in Palestine have dared to declare themselves independent and it is time to decide how we shall proceed regarding the 'State of Israel.' We can help the Arabs of Palestine in their struggle by sending volunteers and supplies or by joining the fight directly. The only other alternative is to accept the existence of Israel and officially recognize them. This decision would be met with very little support among the public, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME335001;An Armistice with Israel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC335001;The war with Israel did not go as planned. Not only was the initial resistance of the Jewish settlers successful, as we initially thought, but Israeli troops managed to mount a counter-offensive and do now occupy Syrian territory. Due to manipulation of the press, the people are not ready for such dire news. It may be a wise decision to ask for a chease-fire now, before our situation becomes even more desperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA335001;We have no choice – ask for an armistice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB335001;Peace with Israel? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME335002;Another Chance for a Cease-fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC335002;Despite all the effort we put into the war to liberate Palestine, the tide has not turned in our favor as foreign soldiers have crossed the borders and marched into Syria. The people are enraged and demand an end to this humiliating war and they urge you to sign a ceasie-fire and to agree to an armistice. The appetite to risk the rest of the country is very thin, what is our plan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA335002;End it now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB335002;We fight to the last man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME335003;Palestine is Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC335003;Finally, the war is over. The Jewish settlers have been ousted and Arabs alone will rule Palestine in the future. The control over all territories currently occupied will be handed over to the Palestine government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA335003;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME335004;The Partition of Palestine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC335004;The dream of a Jewish state in Palestine was short-lived. Ther Israeli forces could not withstand the storm Arab troops determined to not let the 'State of Israel' be more than fantasy. Now, all Jews have fled Palestine and the future of the region is discussed among the Arab states. It has been decided to dive the area between Egypt, Jordan and Syria and integrate the Palestinians into the respective societies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA335004;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME335005;The Fate of Palestine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC335005;Now that Israel is no more, we can either let the Palestinians rule themselves or dividing Palestine between its neighbor states. The latter option would allow us to extend our sphere, but will not be welcomed by the UN members who supported a partition of Plaestine into an Jewish and an Arab state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
